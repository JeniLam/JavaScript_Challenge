# Javascript_Challenge

## UFO-Level 1

For the first part of this challenge I had to create a basic html web page in which UFO sighing data in the form of JavaScript Ojbects were automatically loaded onto the page.  Once the webpage loaded, it was required to write code which appends the data within the table based on the date provided by the user.  

## UFO-Level 2

For the secod portion of this challenge, required the same from level 1, however additional filters were added so the data could be filtered by one or all of the following:
  1. date
  2. city
  3. state
  4. country
  5. shape
  
JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js were used on both levels of this challenge.
